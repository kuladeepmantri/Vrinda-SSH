# Vrinda-SSH
## About
I am proud to introduce Vrinda-SSH, a tool developed as part of my personal project. The name "Vrinda," which means basil in Sanskrit, was chosen for its connotations of strength and resilience - perfect for an attack tool. Vrinda-SSH is designed to test the security of network by brute-forcing the specified IP address using a provided wordlist via SSH (p22).

One of the key features of Vrinda-SSH is its speed and efficiency, thanks to the inclusion of threading and paralyzation support. While it is still a work in progress and may have some bugs, I have big plans for the future of Vrinda-SSH. In the coming months and years, I hope to add a progress bar, support for key-based and multifactor attacks, and possibly even a GUI.

I am excited to continue developing and improving Vrinda-SSH, and hope that it will become a valuable tool for anyone looking to test the strength of their Network.
